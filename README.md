The project object was copying a prior project made in the Driven BootCamp, but this time it was made using only React.JS. Besides the obvious layout, there are some dynamic features in this project such as: functional like button(with changes in the like count) and "save post" button, possibilitie of changing you own profile name and photo. It's important to make it known that this is only and introductory project, and many more, more complexs projects are still to come.
